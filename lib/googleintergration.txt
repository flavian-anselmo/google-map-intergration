*************how to intergrate google maps in flutter for delivery apps**********
create and set up a new google cloud paltform

Add Google Maps SDK (for both Android & iOS) and Directions API to the GCP project

Create an API Key on GCP

Setup Flutter project to use Google Maps

Add Google Maps widget

Use Geocoding to translate coordinates into a place address and vice versa

Use Polylines for drawing route between two places

Calculate distance of that route


google maps widgets 
initialCameraPosition: This is a required parameter that is used for loading the map view on initial start-up.

myLocationEnabled: For showing your current location on the map with a blue dot.

myLocationButtonEnabled: This button is used to bring the user location to the center of the camera view.

mapType: For specifying the displayed map type (normal, satellite, hybrid or terrain).

zoomGesturesEnabled: Whether the map view should respond to zoom gestures.

zoomControlsEnabled: Whether to show zoom controls (only applicable for Android).

onMapCreated: Callback for when the map is ready to use.


geocoding 
whenyou have the initial app and working you can move on adding two 
places and finding the suitable route between them on the map 
for this you will need the lattitude and the longitude of these places 
since figuring out the geographic coordinates can pretty comlicateed we will use geocoding 

geocoding is a technique by which the address of a place can be converted into coordinates 
(lattitudes and viceversa )

place markers 
you can use the coordinates retrieved in the previous step to place markers on the map 
have a var to store the markers 
then create the markers 
add the markers the display them in the map
